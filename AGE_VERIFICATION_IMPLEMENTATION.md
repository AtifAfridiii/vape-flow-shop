# Age Verification Modal Implementation

## Overview
An age verification modal has been successfully implemented for the VapeShop website. The modal appears on the user's first visit and requires them to confirm they are 18 years or older before accessing the site.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Modal Content
- **Message**: "You Must Be 18 or Over to Enter This Site"
- **Logo**: VapeShop logo displayed at the top (https://www.no1ukvapesupplier.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/logo_220x@2x.png?v=1722962006)
- **Buttons**: "Yes" and "No" buttons for user action
- **Description**: Additional confirmation text explaining the age requirement

### ✅ Functionality
- **First Visit Detection**: Modal appears only on the user's first visit using sessionStorage
- **Yes Button**: Closes the modal and allows full access to the website
- **No Button**: Redirects the user to a blank page (about:blank)
- **Non-Dismissible**: Cannot be closed by clicking outside or pressing ESC
- **Session Storage**: User confirmation is stored in sessionStorage to prevent repeated prompts during the same session

### ✅ Design Requirements
- **Full-Page Overlay**: Semi-transparent black backdrop (70% opacity) covers the entire page
- **Centered Modal**: Content is centered both horizontally and vertically on the screen
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly with proper padding and flexible layout
- **Professional Styling**: Matches the website's design aesthetic using Tailwind CSS
- **Consistent Colors**: Uses the site's color palette (navy blue primary, professional minimal design)

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- **`src/components/AgeVerificationModal.tsx`** - Main age verification modal component

### Modified Files
- **`src/App.tsx`** - Added AgeVerificationModal import and component to the app root

## Technical Details

### Component Structure
```
AgeVerificationModal
├── Backdrop (semi-transparent overlay)
└── Modal Container
    └── Modal Content
        ├── Logo Image
        ├── Title
        ├── Description
        └── Button Group (Yes/No)
```

### State Management
- Uses React `useState` for modal visibility
- Uses React `useEffect` for checking sessionStorage on mount
- sessionStorage key: `"ageVerified"`

### Styling
- Built with Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Uses shadcn/ui Button component for consistency
- Z-index layering: backdrop (z-40), modal (z-50)
- Responsive padding and sizing for mobile devices

## How It Works

1. **On Page Load**: The component checks if `ageVerified` exists in sessionStorage
2. **First Visit**: If not found, the modal becomes visible
3. **User Action**:
   - **Clicks "Yes"**: Sets `ageVerified` to "true" in sessionStorage and closes modal
   - **Clicks "No"**: Redirects to about:blank
4. **Subsequent Visits**: Modal doesn't appear because sessionStorage still contains the verification

## Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Uses standard Web APIs (sessionStorage, window.location)
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Open the website in a new browser tab - modal should appear
2. Click "Yes" - modal should close and site should be accessible
3. Refresh the page - modal should NOT appear (same session)
4. Open in a new tab/window - modal should appear again (new session)
5. Click "No" - should redirect to about:blank

### Browser DevTools Testing
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application > Session Storage
3. Verify `ageVerified` key is set after clicking "Yes"
4. Clear sessionStorage and refresh to see modal again

## Customization Options

### To Change Redirect URL
Edit line 25 in `AgeVerificationModal.tsx`:
```typescript
window.location.href = "about:blank"; // Change this URL
```

### To Use localStorage Instead
Replace `sessionStorage` with `localStorage` for persistent storage across sessions:
```typescript
localStorage.setItem("ageVerified", "true");
const ageVerified = localStorage.getItem("ageVerified");
```

### To Add Expiration
Implement a timestamp-based expiration:
```typescript
const expirationTime = Date.now() + (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // 24 hours
sessionStorage.setItem("ageVerified", JSON.stringify({ verified: true, expires: expirationTime }));
```

## Accessibility Considerations
- Modal uses semantic HTML structure
- Buttons are properly labeled and accessible
- High contrast between text and background
- Responsive design works with screen readers

## Performance
- Minimal performance impact
- Component only renders when needed
- No external dependencies beyond existing project libraries
- Lightweight CSS using Tailwind utilities

## Future Enhancements
- Add date picker for actual age verification
- Implement backend verification with cookies
- Add analytics tracking for verification events
- Support for multiple languages
- Add animation/transition effects
